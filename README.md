# School_District_Analysis

## Discoveries made while performing the analysis:
After cleaning the data (removing any missing or duplicated values), I generated the summary statistics for each DataFrame.
After doing this, I was able to find the below information:
- Average math score
- Minimum reading score

And some other specific values. I also prepared the data to be able to find specific information per grade.

I also found out some comparisons between District and Charter Schools, finding the average budget for each school type for example.


## Additional analysis I believe would be worthwhile:
I believe it would be interesting to find out the different average reading and math scores per school, to see which one is better at teaching those classes and potentially, review the learning material on those schools with lower average grades.
